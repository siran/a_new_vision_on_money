Human beings are often in a constant struggle to avoid pain and seek as much pleasure as possible. The Course offers us a different objective. 

The Course teaches us that what shares the same purpose is the same.

In this sense, pleasure and pain are the same, as they share the same purpose, and that purpose is to keep us separated from God.

We all want our pain to be healed, but almost no one has considered that they must also be healed from their pleasures.

The Course teaches us that it is not necessary to fight against the temptation of pleasure, but rather, we must align our efforts with accepting the miracles that God offers us, so we can be witnesses to the world of a more sensible alternative.

If all your efforts are focused on this new objective, money becomes entirely secondary in your life, and you allow God to be the one who provides for your needs.
