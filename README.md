A new vision on money was conceived by Jose Lorenzo Rodriguez.

Jose Lorenzo is a great communicator. We pride ourselves with his ability to simplify complex topics to make them easily digestable.

In this case, he writes (and I translate) A New Vision on Money, which pretends to makes us see the worldwide believed illusion that money is required for anything.

These are concepts extracted, summarized and put together from [A Course In Miracles](https://acimce.app/).


*Nothing real can be threatened. Nothing unreal exists. Herein lies the Peace of God.*
