"A New Vision on Money" was conceived by Jose Lorenzo Rodriguez, based on the teachings of [A Course In Miracles](https://acimce.app/).

Jose Lorenzo is a great communicator. We pride ourselves with his ability to simplify complex topics and making them easily digestable.

In this case, he writes (and I translate) A New Vision on Money; which pretends to makes us see the worldwide believed illusion that money is required for anything.


*Nothing real can be threatened. Nothing unreal exists. Herein lies the Peace of God.*
